## Introduction
This project provides a comprehensive guide and setup for running Apache Airflow within a Docker-in-Docker (DinD) environment. It is designed to help users understand how to deploy and manage Airflow using Docker containers, and then leverage Docker operations within Airflow itself.

By the end of this project, you'll have a fully functional Airflow setup running inside Docker, with the capability to perform Docker operations directly from your Airflow tasks. This is an ideal setup for those looking to automate complex workflows that involve managing containerized applications or services.
